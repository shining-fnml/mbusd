.SH DESCRIPTION
\fImbusd\fR is MODBUS/TCP to MODBUS/RTU gateway.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-h\fR
Usage help.
.IP \fB-d\fR
Instruct \fImbusd\fR not to fork itself (non-daemonize).
.IP \fB-t\fR
Enable RTS RS-485 data direction control (if not disabled while compile).
.IP "\fB-y \fIfile\fR"
Enable RS-485 direction data direction control by writing '1' to file
for transmitter enable and '0' to file for transmitter disable
.IP "\fB-Y \fIfile\fR"
Enable RS-485 direction data direction control by writing '0' to file
for transmitter enable and '1' to file for transmitter disable
.IP "\fB-v \fIlevel\fR"
Specifies log verbosity level. 0 enables logging of errors only,
1 also enables warnings and 2 enables information messages.
If \fImbusd\fR was compiled in debug mode, valid log levels are up to 9,
where log levels above 2 forces logging of information about additional
internal events.
.IP "\fB-L \fIlogfile\fR"
Specifies log file name ('-' for logging to STDOUT only, default is /var/log/mbusd.log).
.IP "\fB-p \fIdevice\fR"
Specifies serial port device name.
.IP "\fB-s \fIspeed\fR"
Specifies serial port speed.
.IP "\fB-m \fImode\fR"
Specifies serial port mode (like 8N1).
.IP "\fB-x \fIfile\fR"
Allow some slaves to use different serial settings than those given on the command line. For this purpose \fImbusd\fR reads the specified text file (eg. /etc/mbusd.ttyS0) that contains lines like the following:
.PP
.RS 12
15 9600 8N1
.RE
.IP
Then \fImbusd\fR will set speed at 9600 and port mode 8N1 to communicate with slave 15 only, using the settings that come with the \fB-s\fR and \fB-x\fR switches with all the other slaves. This option is useful only in a "mixed environment", actually when slaves with different serial parameters share the same physical line.
.IP "\fB-P \fIport\fR"
Specifies TCP port number.
.IP "\fB-C \fImaxconn\fR"
Specifies maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections.
.IP "\fB-N \fIretries\fR"
Specifies maximum number of request retries (0 - disable retries).
.IP "\fB-R \fIpause\fR"
Specifies pause between requests in milliseconds.
.IP "\fB-W \fIwait\fR"
Specifies response wait time in milliseconds.
.IP "\fB-T \fItimeout\fR"
Specifies connection timeout value in seconds (0 - disable timeout).
.SH NOTES
In case of situation when \fImbusd\fR received response with invalid CRC and can't correct
error by re-request, it return MODBUS/TCP packet with exception code 04. In case of situation
when \fImbusd\fR can't receive response from MODBUS RTU device (e.g. addressed controller
is not present on the network), it return MODBUS/TCP packet with exception code 0x0B.
.SH BUGS
Broadcast messaging on MODBUS network isn't supported.
